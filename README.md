# wow-hall-of-fame

:warning: this project is deprecated, as the [Wracraftlogs API](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/api/docs) is now in V2 and uses GraphQL.

Also, nobody runs the in-game encounters that we are parsing anymore, so it is no longer relevant.

This is a [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) project to emulate an "achievements"-like website for WoW classic, based on the [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com](Warcraftlogs) data reports.

It uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) and [Vuetifiy](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/).
